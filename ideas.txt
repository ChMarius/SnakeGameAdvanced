Print the map, depending on the score
Increase the width and height the map by multiplying with a variable???
    int level=1;
        height*=level;
        width*=level;
    Everytime, the player goes to the next level, the map increases.   

Level = 1  2  3  4 
Score = 0  4  8  12

?? Implement another function for level changes and level checking
