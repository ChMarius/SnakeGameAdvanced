# Snake-Game

The project started from a youtube tutorial, when I started learning C++, but over time I added some features like levels, map expansion, etc.

Things to fix: 
1. Pace variable for every level increase
2. The score reset after every level increase (DONE)
3. Map increasing needs restructuring
